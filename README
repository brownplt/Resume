Hardware Requirements
---------------------

+ Linux-capable system with at least 256 MB RAM.
+ Sufficient disk space for letters that are uploaded by users.

Software Requirements
---------------------

+ Python 2.4.4 (Python 2.5 does _not_ work)
  * python-SQLObject==0.7.1
  * python-cjson (i686-Linux binary included)
  * python-mysqldb
+ Apache 2
  * mod_python
+ MySQL
+ An SMTP / SSMTP server (Resume makes heavy use of email)
+ anti-word (Resume converts uploaded .doc files into .pdf files.)
+ tex.  On Debian, install the package tetex-extra in addition to tetex.
  (Consolidated reviews are formatted using TeX.)
+ pdftk>=1.41 (Used for PDF magic.)
+ TexML: http://getfo.org/texml/index.html

Installation
------------

Modify resume/config.py as appropriate

cd resume && ./install.py initdb
cd resume && ./install.py create

Add resume.conf to apache2/sites-enabled, after appropriate modifications.

Ensure that resume/logs and resume/uploads are writable by www-data.

Create the files resume/logs/resume.log and resume/logs/email.log.
Make them writable by www-data.

Make the resume/ directory writable by www-data (so that compiled .pyc files
can be created by mod_python).

Database Setup
--------------

By default, resume stores data in a MySQL database.  Configuration instructions follow:

$ sudo -s
# mysql
mysql> CREATE USER 'resume'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'resume';
mysql> CREATE DATABASE resume;
mysql> GRANT ALL ON resume.* TO 'resume'@'localhost';

Testing
-------

If you do not receive any Python errors during 'initdb' and 'create', the MySQL
and Python requirements were met.

If you see the front page (default: localhost/brownhort) and login to the
administrator's account, the Apache requirements were met.

If you create a new account and receive email from Resume, the email system
is correctly configured.

If you can work through the interactive tour, Resume works with your browser.

Backup Data
-----------

You should setup your system to backup data that's uploaded to Resume.
Important pieces include:

+ The SQL database.  See resume/config.py for the name of the database.  The
  default name is 'resume'.
+ Uploaded content.  The default directory is 'uploads/'.

Misc
----

The "interactive tour" creates a complete new department, so it takes some time
to load.  The demo page (static-base/loaddemo.html) prints "this is taking
really long, please contact the sysadmin" after 15 seconds.  You may want to
tweak the timeout based on your server's performance.
