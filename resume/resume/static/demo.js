/* demo.js : Functionality for "Demo-ing" Javascript applications.

 * Say you have an application that you want to show off to potential
 * users.  Rather than passive screenshots, you'd like them to sample
 * the actual, running application.  But you'd like to do it while
 * watching over the shoulders, saying, "Click here" and "Did you see
 * that there?"

 * That's what this, the Flapjax Demo Tool, lets you do.  You can run
 * your application in a managed setting, allowing the user to
 * interact and experiment with your interface while you guide them.

 * In what follows, we'll need separate names for three programs.  The
 * first is the program being demo'ed; we'll call this the
 * Application.  The second is this support library that enables
 * demos; we'll call it the Manager.  Finally there is the actual demo
 * program that you write to show off the Application; we'll call
 * that, obviously, the Demo.

 * You will have to modify your Application slightly, but we've worked
 * hard to make sure you need to modify it *very* slightly.  All the
 * Application needs to do is expose the interesting events to the
 * Manager through the interface described below.  The Manager
 * consists of a state machine that changes states based on these
 * events. Each state has accompanying text that guides the user
 * through the application.

 * To expose events to the Manager, every page of the Application that
 * you care to include in the demo must add a "startDemo" function to
 * its document object at load time. This function takes a callback,
 * which the underlying application must call whenever an action
 * occurs. The callback takes one argument: an object that includes an
 * "action" attribute, which contains the name of the action that just
 * occured.  This object is passed by the Manager to its state
 * machine.

/* State :: String x String x ElementId? -> State

 * Models a state in a "demo" state machine.  States have transitions
 * to other states, which occur on certain actions.  Each state has a
 * name, as well as a blurb that can be displayed alongside the
 * appropriate state in the Application.
 *
 * States also have "highlight actions".  If the Demo invokes
 * setHighlight, then when the state's blurb is displayed, a special
 * link will be displayed alongside.  This link, when clicked, will
 * run a designated function (hlOn) that is meant to be used for
 * highlighting parts of the page to which the user's attention should
 * be drawn.  The accompanying hlOff function, which should reverse
 * whatever changes have been made, is called when leaving the state.
 *
 * The easiest way to set a highlight action is to supply the element id as
 * the optional third argument.  This highlights the element using
 * makeHighlighters.  For custom highlights, use setHighlight.
